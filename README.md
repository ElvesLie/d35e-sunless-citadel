## Welcome to 3.5e Adventure Companion for Sunless Citadel
This companion is designed to help you easily run one of the Classic adventures for 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons. With ready to be used maps filled with monsters that are waiting for adventurers, items that you can give to party and traps ready to be sprung, this companion will allow you to focus on the adventure - not the preparation stuff.

### Maps
This companion has core maps of the adventure prepared. Both levels of Citadel and Oakhurst are remade, with lighting, walls and hazards set up. Each room is numbered so you can easily refer to original adventure for reference.

### Monsters
Monsters found in the adventure are placed in approprieate rooms and are ready to be fought! They stats were updated to match their 3.5 edition SRD counterparts, so they are more in line with the rest of the system.

### Items
Treasures found during adventuring are all added so you can easily distribute them between players.
